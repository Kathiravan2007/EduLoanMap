**🎓 EduLoanMap: Your College Loan Navigator 🚀**
**🌟 Overview**

Education is the key to a brighter future, but soaring college fees often block the way — especially for hardworking families with modest incomes. Many students and parents don’t know about easy student loans offered by banks, some even without collateral! That’s where EduLoanMap comes in — a simple, smart tool to find, compare, and calculate student loans for your college dreams! 🎯

**🚀 Features**

🔍 Search colleges and branches effortlessly

🏦 Compare loan offers from multiple banks side-by-side

💰 See loan amounts, interest rates, and collateral requirements clearly

💡 Motivation

As a student myself, facing hefty college fees was daunting. Even though my college partnered with banks offering collateral-free loans, many of us didn’t know how to access them. EduLoanMap is built to bridge this knowledge gap and help students and parents take charge of their education financing! 🎓💪
